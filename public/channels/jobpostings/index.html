<meta name="description" content="Overview At ZATech we get quite a lot of jobpostings so having good communication is super important to ensure high signal and low noise.
We have a jobposting tool which will format a post nicely for you, see the &ldquo;How do I post a job opportunity?&rdquo; for more information.
Guidelines: A great description tries to do the following:
Pitch the applicant on what work they&rsquo;ll do in the job Pitch what the company itself does Motivate why someone would pick your role over another (Obviously it goes without saying that professional recruitment is not allowed, please see the Code of Conduct if you&rsquo;re unsure)">
