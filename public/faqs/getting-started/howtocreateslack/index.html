<title>How do I create a Slack like this one? | ZATech Wiki</title>
<meta name="description" content="ZATech is a non-profit and we&rsquo;re on the NPO Slack plan. Previously, Slack did not enforce the 250 person limit for non-profits, but they&rsquo;ve recently told us that they intend to start doing this so we&rsquo;ll need to figure out how to find thousands of dollars to pay them, or downgrade to the free plan with limited features and history.
If you want to start you own Slack, the free version is pretty good if you don&rsquo;t care about history (most people actually don&rsquo;t). Alternatively, you can use Discord which currently provides more generous features for free.">

<p>The hard part is actually getting people to join and engage. ZATech was created by N1c 10+ years ago &rsquo;to chat with friends&rsquo; and the initial growth was organic, so we don&rsquo;t have much advice on how to replicate that bit.</p>
