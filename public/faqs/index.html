      <h2>How do I create a Slack like this one?</h2>
      <div><p>ZATech is a non-profit and we&rsquo;re on the NPO Slack plan. Previously, Slack did not enforce the 250 person limit for non-profits, but they&rsquo;ve recently told us that they intend to start doing this so we&rsquo;ll need to figure out how to find thousands of dollars to pay them, or downgrade to the free plan with limited features and history.</p>
<p>If you want to start you own Slack, the free version is pretty good if you don&rsquo;t care about history (most people actually don&rsquo;t). Alternatively, you can use Discord which currently provides more generous features for free.</p>
<p>The hard part is actually getting people to join and engage. ZATech was created by N1c 10+ years ago &rsquo;to chat with friends&rsquo; and the initial growth was organic, so we don&rsquo;t have much advice on how to replicate that bit.</p>

      <h2>Is it self promotion?</h2>
      <div><p>Our Code of Conduct discourages self-promotion, but definining self-promotion is somewhat of a grey area.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t spam the channels with links, or links to pages, for the purpose of monetization of user views and which provide no value to the community</p></blockquote>
<p>If you think your own project provides value and interest to the community, you can sometimes share it anyway, even if you have a financial incentive for doing so.</p>
<p>Some pointers:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you&rsquo;re new to the community, people are going to be a lot less welcoming to even mild self-promotion. If they know who you are, they might be more welcoming of it. Think about why you are on ZATech. If you&rsquo;re primarily here because you heard it&rsquo;s a good place to reach South African tech professionals, you&rsquo;re probably spamming. If you&rsquo;re around to ask and answer questions, discuss things, etc and happen to do some self promotion on the side, it might be OK.</li>
<li>Read the room: different channels will be accepting of different levels of self-promotion. For example, <code>#developers</code> is generally pretty anti any kind of self-promotion while <code>#shameless-advertising</code> is open to most kinds of self-promotion (though clear spam/scam messages are still not allowed). Channels like <code>#startups</code> are somewhere in between. Read the previous messages and get to know some of the more familiar faces before posting self-promotional stuff.</li>
<li>Avoid cross-posting self-promotional stuff: sometimes people will post a question or link to a few different relevant channels. This is generally something to avoid anyway (as related channels will often have a big overlap in membership so you end up forcing many people to see the same thing more than once), but should always be avoided in cases where you are promoting something.</li>
<li>Accept the feedback: if people tell you they are not interested, or ignore you, then accept that it was probably not interesting to our community.</li>
