If they know who you are, they might be more welcoming of it. Think about why you are on ZATech. If you’re primarily here because you heard it’s a good place to reach South African tech professionals, you’re probably spamming. If you’re around to ask and answer questions, discuss things, etc and happen to do some self promotion on the side, it might be OK. Read the room: different channels will be accepting of different levels of self-promotion. For example, #developers is generally pretty anti any kind of self-promotion while #shameless-advertising is open to most kinds of self-promotion (though clear spam/scam messages are still not allowed). Channels like #startups are somewhere in between. Read the previous messages and get to know some of the more familiar faces before posting self-promotional stuff. Avoid cross-posting self-promotional stuff: sometimes people will post a question or link to a few different relevant channels. This is generally something to avoid anyway (as related channels will often have a big overlap in membership so you end up forcing many people to see the same thing more than once), but should always be avoided in cases where you are promoting something. Accept the feedback: if people tell you they are not interested, or ignore you, then accept that it was probably not interesting to our community.

Ie. a 100Ah 12V battery, will be able to output 100A at 12V from 100% to “empty” for an hour… and then it’s empty\nkWh -\u003e 1000Wh - The average Watts that was consumed during an hour\nEfficiency: The percentage of power taken from the one side, that would be produced on the otherside, ie. 85% of 100Ah @ 12V := 1200kWh * 0.85 =\u003e ~= 1020kWh producing ~4.6A at 240V (Ditto for charging etc. from Solar/Grid to battery/etc.)\nIf you now wants to calculate the storage needed for a Stage2 - expecting 2 hours everyday:\nget the expected Watts consumed (see https://zatech.slack.com/archives/CG4HBE0NB/p1669313627523599 ) for 1 hour multiply the 1hour’s value above by the number of hours you need to keep up, taking into account the overruns, and the expectations that charging might not be completed fully during day. Now you have two numbers: kVA - the output maximums you need to cater for (ie. how many computers on, compare this with the size of a water pipe) and kWh ie. the amount of storage needed compare with the size of the storage tank that feeds the pipe. Those two numbers you can then take to installers/etc. to compare or calculate by adding the needed sizes of batteries, the UPS and the solar power needed to fill them batteries/storage tanks.
