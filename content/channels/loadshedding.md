## FAQ

<details>
<summary>How big a system do I need to power my devices?</summary>
<p>Option A: Measure actual startup peaks and average usage.  
Option B: Use equipment specs to estimate load and storage needs.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is kWh, Ah, and kVA?</summary>
<p>- **A** = Current draw  
- **kVA** ≈ Watts (Amps × Volts ÷ 1000)  
- **W** = Power (V × A)  
- **Ah** = Battery capacity (100Ah @ 12V ≈ 100A for 1 hour)  
- **kWh** = Energy consumed in 1 hour</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I calculate storage needs?</summary>
<p>1. Estimate watts consumed per hour  
2. Multiply by expected outage hours  
3. Compare kVA (output) vs kWh (storage)  
4. Size UPS, batteries, and solar accordingly</p>
